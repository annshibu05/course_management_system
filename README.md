Online Course Management System

This project is a web-based application designed to help colleges manage and track online courses completed by students on platforms like Coursera, Udemy, edX, and others. It provides a streamlined way for students to submit their completed course details and certificates, and for college administrators to review, verify, and maintain a centralized record.
